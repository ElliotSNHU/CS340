Client/Server Development



How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I like to do research ahead of time to get an understanding of the requirements of the project. This makes organizing my code easier as I can write comments and start the structure of my blocking. Working with variables that can be adapted with user input is important to ensure that the code is easy to understand if any other developer needs to read and work on your existing code. Writing code in a modular way helps reusability, for example the code we wrote for the first project was directly usable for project two, which saved time. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Critical thinking and problem solving are the main skills required for a successful programmer. Breaking the problems into digestable sections helps my brain solve the more complex problems. During this project, I took each step and slowly worked it out and confirmed it worked before moving on to the next step. I like working this way so I don't have four functions that are half built and non-functional. Writing test cases is a great way to test the program and should be tested frequently throughout development to uncover any bugs that may arise. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do a wide range of activities since the term covers quite a bit. Focusing on software engineering, the goal is to provide a product or tool that makes tasks quicker and simpler to understand. Grazioso Salvare wanted a dashboard that allowed them to refine their large database and locate where specific animals were for rescue scenarios. Before, someone would have to read through entries on paper, or a CSV file to find all the possible outcomes. Now, the user can simply select a radio button and it cut the searching out of the equation. It's reusable and quick as well, which saves the company endless amounts of time. This matters because companies want efficiency. In the general sense, computer scientists work on making tasks easier for everyone, such as emails, photo editing, video game design, hardware specific tasks, and essentially an endless amount of examples.
